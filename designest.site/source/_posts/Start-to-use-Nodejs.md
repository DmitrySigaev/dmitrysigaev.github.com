I had installed VS 2012 and decided to check: Maybe there is Node.js IDE for VS.
It's Cool. Microsoft already thinking about it.
So, follow links:

Node.js Tools for Visual Studio (NTVS)
<hr>
NTVS is a free, open source plugin that turns Visual Studio into a Node.js IDE.
It is designed, developed, and supported by Microsoft and the community.
