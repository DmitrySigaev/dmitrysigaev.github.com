00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,890
Hi. I'm Rebecca from engVid.

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:08,525
In this lesson, I'll show you an
advanced way to improve your English.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,674
Let me start by asking
you a few questions.

4
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:17,563
Do you cut your own hair?
Do you repair your own car?

5
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:20,125
Do you fix your roof?

6
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:25,885
If you're like most people, you probably
do not do those things by yourself;

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,260
you have someone else do
those things for you. Right?

8
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:37,780
So in English, when you have someone else
perform an action for you, we express that

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,979
in a different way, and that's what you're
going to learn in this lesson. Okay? Let's

10
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,920
have a look at the board.

11
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:54,459
Okay, so let's say that you do something by
yourself. Okay? Then you would say, for example:

12
00:00:54,459 --> 00:01:00,582
"I paint the house every year."
That's if you do it by yourself.

13
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:03,730
If you... In the
past, we would say:

14
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:06,924
"I painted the house last year."

15
00:01:07,018 --> 00:01:09,063
In the future, you would say:

16
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:12,369
"I will paint the house
next year." Right?

17
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:17,100
That's when you do the action.
That's the normal way in which

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,358
we construct an
English sentence.

19
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:24,487
But what if you don't do it yourself? What
if somebody else comes in and does it for

20
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:30,680
you? Okay? You hire a painter, and he or she
does the work for you. Then, in English, we

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,349
have to express it in a different way.
We have to express it like this.

22
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:38,096
In the present, it would be:

23
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:41,850
"I have the house
painted every year."

24
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:45,462
So what's special, there? This:

25
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,376
"I have the house
painted every year."

26
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,610
Last year or in the past:

27
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:57,106
"I had the house painted
last year." Okay?

28
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:01,885
See the difference, there? And when
we're talking about the future:

29
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:07,854
"I will have the house
painted next year." Okay?

30
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:08,766
Good.

31
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:15,069
Now, I know that sounds like a mouthful. That
means it sounds like a lot of words, and it

32
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,659
is a lot of words in the beginning until you
understand how it's constructed, but just

33
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:27,571
try to see the difference between: "I paint
the house." and "I have the house painted.",

34
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:33,777
between: "I painted the house."
and "I had the house painted.",

35
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:39,267
between: "I will paint the house."
and "I will have the house painted."

36
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,689
Okay? That's what you
have to do when you

37
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:47,959
are talking about something which someone
else does for you; a service which someone

38
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,027
else performs for you. Okay?

39
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:55,329
Let's look at a few more examples, and then
you'll understand a little better. So let's

40
00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:00,620
say, for example, I don't cut my own hair, and
I guess you don't cut your own hair either.

41
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,228
So, how would you say that? Okay? If somebody
else does it for you? You would say:

42
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:11,937
"I have my hair cut every
month." for example.

43
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:17,019
In the past: "I had my hair
cut." Sorry, it should

44
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,095
be "last month". Okay. And:

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,715
"I will have my hair
cut next month." Okay?

46
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,015
So we have present, past, future.
So what was special, there?

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,480
"I have my hair cut",
"I had my hair cut",

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,880
"I will have my hair cut".

49
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:40,719
Okay? So that's the way we
express it when a hairdresser or

50
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,900
someone else, or a barber, is going
to cut your hair, and not you.

51
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,309
Okay, next. Now, here we're going to talk
about John. John is a rich guy, and he's also

52
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:55,980
doing very well, he makes a lot of money,
but he doesn't like to clean. So he doesn't

53
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,309
clean his own apartment. He calls a maid in to
clean his apartment. So, when we're talking

54
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:06,709
about John, we say... We don't
say: "John cleans his apartment",

55
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:12,337
because he doesn't do it himself; someone
else does it for him. Right? So we say:

56
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:18,234
"John has his apartment
cleaned every week."

57
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,248
Okay. I said he's rich.
Okay, he has the money.

58
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:25,211
"John had his apartment
cleaned last week."

59
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:26,177
Or:

60
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:30,606
"John will have his apartment
cleaned next week."

61
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:32,838
Same construction:

62
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:37,379
"has his apartment cleaned",
"had his apartment cleaned",

63
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,554
"will have his
apartment cleaned".

64
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:44,333
Okay? Same concept in
every single example.

65
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:50,880
Let's take one last example. So, let's say
a hotel-right?-they have many floors, they

66
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,970
have to wash their windows regularly. But they
don't do it themselves; they hire a company

67
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,805
to do that, a window-washing company.
So we could say:

68
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:08,246
"The hotel has its windows
washed every year." Right?

69
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,212
Last year, we're talking
about the past:

70
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:16,550
"The hotel had its windows
washed last year."

71
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:20,550
Here we go. And future:

72
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:25,895
"The hotel will have its
windows washed next year."

73
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,330
Okay? All right.

74
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,364
So, you have just learned a really important
advanced-level point in English grammar.

75
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,620
I hope you've caught it. I'm sure you'd like
to do a little more practice on that, which

76
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,843
would be a very good idea.
For that,

77
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:46,331
go to our website:
www.engvid.com.

78
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:51,743
There you can do a quiz on this and really master
it, because it's quite a big difference. Right?

79
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,191
We don't say: "I cut my hair."
We say: "I have my hair cut."

80
00:05:55,285 --> 00:06:00,038
And these kind of small changes will
improve your English tremendously.

81
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:02,496
For more tips like that
on improving your English

82
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,672
