00:00:02,328 --> 00:00:07,939
Hi. I'm Rebecca from engVid, and this lesson
will help you to write better letters.

2
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:14,994
Whether you need to write a letter for your
IELTS exam, or at work, or in life in general,

3
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:21,523
this lesson will help you because we're going to
focus on eight common letter-writing mistakes.

4
00:00:21,548 --> 00:00:27,985
Okay? Let's see if you know what they
are, and also how to correct them. Okay.

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,736
Number one: "I look
forward to see you.",

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,510
"I look forward to see you."

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:42,579
What's wrong with that? Well, this is a very common
error, actually. Most people don't realize that they're

8
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:48,727
making it, but it's a really important
thing to correct. So, it should be not:

9
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:56,228
"I look forward to see you."
But: "I look forward to

10
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:00,137
seeing you.",

11
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:04,639
"I look forward to seeing you.",
"I look forward to meeting you.",

12
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,674
"I look forward to discussing
these ideas with you." Right?

13
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:14,089
Whatever verb you put here, you need
to say it or write it with "ing".

14
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:15,831
Remember that. Okay.

15
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:18,177
Next, number two:

16
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:20,989
"Tanks your letter." Okay?

17
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,167
This person has written:

18
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,328
"Tanks your letter."

19
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,996
Now, the person
actually wants to say:

20
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:33,535
"Thanks", but many people
make a mistake, first of all,

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,773
in the spelling of this word.

22
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:39,286
It does have an "h" in it,

23
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:43,715
so it should be: "Thanks",

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,205
and then there's another mistake. Right
now it says: "Thanks your letter."

25
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,568
But that's not correct.
It should be: "Thanks",

26
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:57,325
what's the right preposition?
"Thanks",

27
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:04,230
"Thanks for your letter." Okay?
Or:

28
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:09,586
"Thank you for your letter." Okay.
Next, number three:

29
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:14,094
"Please to give my regard to Mr.
Smith.",

30
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,867
"Please to give my regard to Mr.
Smith."

31
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay. There are two mistakes, here.
See if you can find them. Okay. So,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,772
the first one is right here.

33
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:33,096
We don't say: "Please to give", "Please
to write", "Please something".

34
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:38,654
No. We just say: "Please
give", "Please reply". Right?

35
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:41,778
"Please respond", "Please ask".

36
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:44,523
Don't say: "to ask" or
anything like that.

37
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:49,200
"Please give my
regard" is not right.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,565
It should be

39
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,141
"regards".

40
00:02:56,196 --> 00:03:02,820
"Please give my regards to Mr. Smith."
All right? We can't say "regard"

41
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,331
just like that, without the "s",
so make sure you add an "s" there.

42
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:12,199
Number four: "I am
interesting your products.",

43
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,913
"I am interesting
your products."

44
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:21,852
That's not right. We need to say, what?
Can you find the mistake?

45
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:24,624
Here.

46
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:32,397
"I am interested", okay?

47
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:41,220
"I am interested", your products are interesting.
So the thing you're talking about is with

48
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:48,050
the "ing". The product is interesting, the
book is interesting, the movie is interesting.

49
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,010
Okay? But when we talk about my feelings or
somebody's feelings about that, we have to

50
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:02,150
say that with the "ed". "I am interested",
"I am excited", okay? Like that. But there's

51
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,553
still one other small mistake, now.
Now it says:

52
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,646
"I am interested your products."

53
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:15,070
So this part is right: "I am interested", but
we need to have a preposition after that.

54
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,819
What is it? "I am interested

55
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,095
in",

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,785
"I am interested in your
products." Okay? Good.

57
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,059
Number five:

58
00:04:27,084 --> 00:04:30,737
"When I will be in
London, I'll call you."

59
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:31,799
Okay?

60
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:35,373
"When I will be in
London, I'll call you."

61
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:41,730
In many languages, this would... This
kind of structure would be correct, but

62
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,770
in English, it's not, because there are really
two parts to this sentence. Right? This one:

63
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,744
"When I will be in London",

64
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:53,529
and then the other
part: "I'll call you".

65
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:57,422
So I'll help you to find the
mistake by telling you that

66
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,633
this part of the sentence
is actually fine.

67
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:04,903
"I'll call you" is short
for "I will call you",

68
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:09,492
that's fine, but in this
part of the sentence

69
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:19,600
which has a conditional word-all right?-we
do not put the future tense. We write, here,

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,639
we use, here, the present simple tense. So,
instead of saying: "When I will be in London",

71
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,184
we say: "When I"...

72
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:35,484
"When I am in London" or "When I'm
in London, I'll call you." Okay?

73
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:41,250
So when you have a sentence like that in the
future and you're going to... You have two

74
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:49,190
parts that have future in one section, in the
other section don't use the future tense,

75
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,630
just use present simple. And it doesn't matter
what the order is. It's the same principle

76
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,257
if the sentence was:
"I'll call you", right?

77
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:02,851
"I'll call you when
I'm in London."

78
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:07,640
So even if we change the order, the
principle stays the same. Okay.

79
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:11,696
Number six: "It was
pleasure to meet you."

80
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:16,293
This one's almost right,
but not completely right.

81
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,263
So, what's wrong, here?

82
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:22,701
It should be: "It was

83
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,885
a pleasure".

84
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,832
Okay? We need to have
that article "a".

85
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:30,120
"It was a pleasure
to meet you.",

86
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:32,650
"It was a pleasure
to see you again."

87
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,838
And so on.

88
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:38,867
Number seven: "We must
to inform the client.",

89
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:42,429
"We must to inform the client."

90
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:47,346
Well, that's wrong. In this case
we don't have to add something;

91
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:51,394
we need to take something out.
What is it?

92
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,340
We need to take out the word

93
00:06:54,365 --> 00:07:01,808
"to". So, after a modal like
that, "must", we can't use "to".

94
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:05,808
Not: "We must to inform", just:
"We must inform the client.",

95
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,734
"We should inform the client.",

96
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,671
"We could inform the client."

97
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,415
All those kind of words-right?-"could",
"should", "must",

98
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,316
we don't need to say "to". So just:
"We must inform the client." Good.

99
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:22,706
And the last one, look at it carefully.
It says:

100
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:26,402
"Yours sincerely,"
the words are right,

101
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:30,560
but there is still a mistake there.
Can you find the mistake?

102
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,810
"Yours sincerly,"

103
00:07:32,888 --> 00:07:39,040
this word is one of the most misspelled
words in the English language.

104
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:41,714
So, I hope you're not
making that mistake.

105
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:46,055
So the correct spelling
of "sincerely" is...

106
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:57,879
Okay? Sincere, just
like the word "sincere"

107
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:03,554
has an "e" at the end, keep that
"e" when you add "ly". Okay?

108
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:09,336
S-i-n-c-e-r-e-l-y.

109
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:15,960
Many people leave out the "e". All right? So
make sure you're not one of them, especially if

110
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,610
you sign your letters saying: "Sincerely," or:
"Yours sincerely," which is a very common

111
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,308
way to end a general letter or a
general business letter. Okay?

112
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:32,889
So make sure that you are not making these
very common mistakes. If you want to make

113
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,659
sure that you understand this... These mistakes
really well and that you don't make them,

luck with your English.

Bye for now.
